The snapshot set will be created on the same appliance as the source volume group.A snapshot of a volume group will result in a new volume group of __Snapshot__ type. The snapshot set will belong to the same family as the source volume group.When the source of a snapshot operation is a primary or clone volume group, * __source_id__ of the snapshot set will be set to the identifier of the source volume group. * __source_time__ of the snapshot set will be set to the time at which the snapshot set will be created.The __is_write_order_consistent__ property of the source volume group determines whether the snapshot set will be write-order consistent.",
