After a successful cancellation, the host is mapped to original source volume, all paths are cleaned up, and the import state is Cancelled. The import can be attempted again in the future. In most cases, the Cancel operation gracefully rolls back the import based on the source and host error responses. Use the force option to stop the import job irrespective of whether the storage system or hosts have issues. When the force option is true, the import process tries to reach out to the source and host to gracefully terminate the import. If either are not reachable or if the request fails, the import is terminated without rolling back.",
