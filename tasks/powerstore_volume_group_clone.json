The clone volume group will be created on the same appliance as the source volume group.A clone of a volume group will result in a new volume group of __Clone__ type. The clone will belong to the same family as the source volume group.When the source of a clone operation is a either primary or clone volume group, * __source_id__ will be set to the identifier of the source volume group. * __source_time__ will be set to the time at which the clone will be created.When the source of a clone operation is a snapshot set, * __source_id__ will be set to the source_id of the source snapshot set. * __source_time__ will be set to the source_time of the source snapshot set.The clone volume group will inherit the value of the __is_write_order_consistent__ property from the source volume group. A clone of a snapshot set is modeled as a clone of the snapshot set's source, created at the same time instant as when the source snapshot set was created.",
