	"description": "Refresh the contents of a volume group (the target volume group) from another volume group in the same family.A backup snapshot set of the target volume group will be created before refresh is attempted. This behavior can be overridden by setting the __create_backup_snap__ property to false. The profile for the backup snapshot set will be auto-generated, unless a custom profile is specified. The auto-generated profile only initializes the name to an auto-generated, unique value. Other optional parameters are not specified.The table below outlines supported modes of operation and resulting updates to __source_id__ and __source_time__ attributes of __protection_data__.|Target volume group|Source volume group|New source_id|New source_time||-|-|-|-||Primary (P1) |Clone (C1)|id of clone (C1)|Current time||Primary (P1) |snapshot set (C1S1) of clone (C1)|id of source snapshot set (C1S1)|source_time of source snapshot set (C1S1)||Clone (C1) |Primary (P1)|id of primary (P1)|Current time||Clone (C1) |snapshot set (S1) of primary (P1)|id of source snapshot set (S1)|source_time of source snapshot set (S1)||Clone (C1) |Clone (C2)|id of source clone(C2)|Current time||Clone (C1) |snapshot set (C2S1) of clone (C2)|id of source snapshot set (C2S1)|source_time of source snapshot set (C2S1)|Refresh operation is only supported if there are no membership changes between the source and target volume groups of the refresh operation. You can refresh a volume group even when the sizes of the volumes in the target volume group have changed. This represents a case where the source volumes have been modified over time and you want to refresh the target to the new state of the source volume group. A volume group that is acting as the destination in a replication session cannot be refreshed.",
